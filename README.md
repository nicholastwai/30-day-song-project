# 30-day-song-project

Hey! The idea of the web app is to create a place where people can share their song selections for each day 
of the 30 Day Song Challenges that we've seen on Instagram. An example is included in the "images.png" file in the repo.

A calendar like the one depicted in the example image will be displayed on the homepage of the website. 
A user may click on a specific day on the calendar and enter their selection for the song that correspoinds with that day's particular theme.

For example, on Day 1: Go-To Karaoke Song, a user may search for Dancing Queen and submit that as their entry. The user may also see what other songs have already been entered.

To search for songs, I'm thinking that we use the Spotify API.
For each entry, we need the song and the name of the user.
